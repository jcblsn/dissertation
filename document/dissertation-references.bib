We fit a components-of-variance model to earnings of the comparison group and use a simple model of program participation to predict the earnings histories of the trainees. These predictions provide an estimate of the effect of training and an overidentification test of the model. Our program estimates are very sensitive to the model of participation (ranging from 200 to 2000), and we conclude that randomized clinical trials are necessary to reliably determine program effects.},

 abstract = {An important problem in econometrics and marketing is to infer the causal impact that a designed market intervention has exerted on an outcome metric over time. This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no intervention taken place. In contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including local trends, seasonality and the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference, we illustrate the statistical properties of our approach on simulated data. We then demonstrate its practical utility by estimating the causal effect of an online advertising campaign on search-related site visits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of state-space models in enabling causal attribution in those settings where a randomised experiment is unavailable. The CausalImpact R package provides an implementation of our approach.},

abstract = {Summary Substantial advances in Bayesian methods for causal inference have been made in recent years. We provide an introduction to Bayesian inference for causal effects for practicing statisticians who have some familiarity with Bayesian models and would like an overview of what it can add to causal estimation in practical settings. In the paper, we demonstrate how priors can induce shrinkage and sparsity in parametric models and be used to perform probabilistic sensitivity analyses around causal assumptions. We provide an overview of nonparametric Bayesian estimation and survey their applications in the causal inference literature. Inference in the point-treatment and time-varying treatment settings are considered. For the latter, we explore both static and dynamic treatment regimes. Throughout, we illustrate implementation using off-the-shelf open source software. We hope to leave the reader with implementation-level knowledge of Bayesian causal inference using both parametric and nonparametric models. All synthetic examples and code used in the paper are publicly available on a companion GitHub repository.},

 abstract = {In a seminal paper Abadie et al (2010) develop the synthetic control procedure for estimating the effect of a treatment, in the presence of a single treated unit and a number of control units, with pre-treatment outcomes observed for all units. The method constructs a set of weights such that covariates and  pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are approximately matched by a weighted average of control units. The weights are  restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which allows the procedure to obtain the weights even when the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control units, a setting that is not uncommon in applications.  In the current paper we propose a more general class of synthetic control estimators that allows researchers to relax some of the restrictions in the ADH method. We allow the weights to be negative, do not necessarily restrict the sum of the weights, and allow for a permanent additive difference between the treated unit and the controls, similar to difference-in-difference procedures. The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the treated and the control units, using regularization methods to deal with a potentially large number of possible control units.},

	ABSTRACT = {The devastating nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, which was triggered by a tsunami in the wake of an earthquake, resulted in the decision to quickly phase out nuclear power and with it implicitly accelerated the German Energiewende (energy transition). To the outside observer, the decision appeared to be spontaneous and possibly due to a distorted perception of the associated risks of nuclear power. From the decision results not only the limiting uses of private property by conventional energy providers, but the exit from nuclear energy has also implications for the energy market. As with every human, political actors decide under uncertainty and incomplete information. Based on these parameters, we emphasize that the decision of a political actor is comparable to management decision-making. The paper takes this as an opportunity to examine the political decision to phase-out nuclear energy by discussing relevant parameters from the perspective of decision theory. We plead for a mandatory consideration of economic findings, especially from decision theory and risk management in political decision-making processes, especially in matters that affect future generations.},
